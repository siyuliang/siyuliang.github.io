  abstract={How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across 49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to this convergence threshold as \textit{acoustic saturation time} (AST). Further analyses of rank–frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a Zipf–Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological, and orthographical structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual evaluation.},

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American, ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation, particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns, is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.},

  abstract={Interlinear glossed text (IGT) creation remains a major bottleneck in linguistic documentation and fieldwork, particularly for low-resource morphologically rich languages. We present a hybrid automatic glossing pipeline that combines neural sequence labeling with large language model (LLM) post-correction, evaluated on Jungar Tuvan, a low-resource Turkic language. Through systematic ablation studies, we show that retrieval-augmented prompting provides substantial gains over random example selection. We further find that morpheme dictionaries paradoxically hurt performance compared to providing no dictionary at all in most cases, and that performance scales approximately logarithmically with the number of few-shot examples. Most significantly, our two-stage pipeline combining a BiLSTM-CRF model with LLM post-correction yields substantial gains for most models, achieving meaningful reductions in annotation workload. Drawing on these findings, we establish concrete design principles for integrating structured prediction models with LLM reasoning in morphologically complex fieldwork contexts. These principles demonstrate that hybrid architectures offer a promising direction for computationally light solutions to automatic linguistic annotation in endangered language documentation.}

  abstract={Tonogenesis—the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into lexical tone—has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully tonal Ü-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.},

  abstract={While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline, particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper’s multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities. Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis. This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate the imbalanced development of speech technology.},

  abstract={The development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has yielded impressive results, but its use in linguistic fieldwork remains limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges, including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists, highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the transcription bottleneck in language documentation.},

  abstract={This study investigates the impact of pitch flattening on automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance across tonal and non-tonal languages. Using vocoder-based signal processing techniques, we created pitch-flattened versions of speech recordings and compared ASR performance against original recordings. Results reveal that tonal languages experience substantially larger performance degradation than non-tonal languages. Analysis of tone confusion matrices shows systematic patterns of misidentification where contour tones collapse toward level tones when pitch information is removed. Calculation of tone’s functional load at syllable and word levels demonstrates that syllable-level functional load strongly predicts ASR vulnerability to pitch flattening, while word-level patterns reflect each language’s morphological structure. These findings illuminate the differential importance of pitch information across languages and suggest that ASR systems for languages with high syllable-level functional load require more robust pitch modeling.},
