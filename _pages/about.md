I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at the [University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/) advised by Drs. **[Gina-Anne Levow](https://faculty.washington.edu/levow/)** and **[Richard Wright](https://depts.washington.edu/phonlab/rawright.php)**. My research interests are phonetics, computational linguistics, field work, and marginally historical linguistics and typology. I'm particularly interested in low-resource speech NLP, language technology, quantitative modeling of speech variation, etc. 

When I’m not working, you can find me on red-eye flights ✈️, at concerts 🎶, in the mountains 🏞️, or occasionally on the wall 🧗. 

You can reach me at liangsy [@] uw [dot] edu.
